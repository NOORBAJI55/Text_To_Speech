# Text_To_Speech
This repository contains a Python script that converts text input into speech using the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library.
The generated speech is saved as an MP3 file and can be played automatically. 
This project demonstrates the basics of text-to-speech conversion and can be extended for more complex applications like voice-based assistants or audiobook generation.
